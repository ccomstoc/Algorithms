# Algorithms

This project showcases a collection of algorithms I studied during my algorithms class.

Within the "bundle" folder, there is a program that executes various algorithms and displays their outcomes. The input configurations are located in [driver.cpp](bundle/driver.cpp), and the corresponding outputs are documented in [Output.txt](bundle/Output.txt). The list of algorithms includes Greedy, Fractional Greedy, Zero-One Knapsack with dynamic programming, Knapsack with backtracking, and Branch & Bound Best First Knapsack.

The "floyd" folder only contains Floyd's algorithm. The input specifications can be found in [driver.cpp](floyds/floyd.cpp), while the corresponding outputs are documented in [outTxt.txt](floyds/outTxt.txt).
